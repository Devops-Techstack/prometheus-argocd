To deploy Prometheus using a Helm chart stored in a Git repository via ArgoCD on Minikube, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:
Minikube and ArgoCD are up and running.
kubectl and Helm are configured.
You have a Git repository that contains the Prometheus Helm chart or a custom configuration file to override the Helm chart's values.

Steps:
1. Set Up the Git Repository for Prometheus:
Fork or clone the Prometheus Helm chart locally by running:
helm pull prometheus-community/prometheus --untar
This command will create a prometheus/ directory with the chart contents.
Commit the prometheus directory to your Git repository (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo).
Customize Values (Optional):
If you want to customize the Prometheus deployment, add a values.yaml file in the repository with any overrides.
2. Create the ArgoCD Application YAML: Create an ArgoCD Application manifest that points to your Git repository. Save this as prometheus-application.yaml.

Apply the ArgoCD Application: Apply the manifest to create the ArgoCD Application:


kubectl apply -f prometheus-application.yaml

Verify in ArgoCD:

Open the ArgoCD UI and confirm that the Prometheus application has synced successfully.
ArgoCD should have pulled the chart from your Git repository and deployed Prometheus in the monitoring namespace.
3. Access the Prometheus UI: Expose the Prometheus service to access it on Minikube:

kubectl patch svc prometheus-server -n monitoring -p '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'
Retrieve the Minikube IP and the NodePort assigned to prometheus-server:

minikube ip
kubectl get svc prometheus-server -n monitoring
Then, open http://<MINIKUBE-IP>:<NODE-PORT> in your browser to access Prometheus.

This should deploy Prometheus using a Helm chart from your Git repository via ArgoCD on Minikube.
